1/ What if the Big Bang wasn’t a singularity, but the aftermath of a higher-dimensional event? I’m releasing a unified framework that embeds all four forces (gravity, EM, strong, weak) in a String/M-theory geometry.

2/ The model replaces the initial singularity with a “brane supernova” in the bulk. The aftershock seeds our 4D universe and yields a modified Friedmann equation with a high-energy ρ^2 term and a dark-radiation component.

3/ Key equation (schematic):
H^2 = (8πG/3) ρ (1 + ρ / 2λ) + C/a^4 − k/a^2 + Λ4/3
This captures the leading correction from brane tension λ and bulk effects (C/a^4).

4/ Why this matters: it unifies all forces within one geometry, offers an origin for our universe without infinities, and makes testable predictions in cosmology and particle physics.

5/ Predictions: broken power-law stochastic GW background (LISA/PTAs), specific CMB anisotropy & non-Gaussian features (CMB-S4/LiteBIRD), ΔN_eff ≈ 0.2–0.4 (CMB+BAO).

6/ Implications: addresses the hierarchy problem via warped dimensions; offers inflation alternatives; suggests observable quantum gravity signatures in the early universe.

7/ The work is open for peer review and collaboration. Full paper + press release here:
