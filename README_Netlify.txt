Deploy to Netlify — August 10, 2025 (UTC)

QUICKEST (no account required):
1) Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2) Drag this entire folder (Unified_Brane_ShareSite_v1) onto the page.
3) Netlify will upload and instantly give you a public URL (e.g., https://something.netlify.app).

With a Netlify account (keeps the site persistent and editable):
1) Log in at https://app.netlify.com/ and click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually".
2) Drag the folder just like above, or connect to a Git repo later.
3) Optional: Set a custom domain in "Domain settings".

Files you'll see here:
- index.html
- assets/ (PDFs, images, JSON)
- netlify.toml  (headers + caching)
- README_GitHub_Pages.txt (GitHub alternative)
- README_Netlify.txt (this file)

Tip: To update the site, just drag-and-drop the folder again. Netlify keeps previous deploys and gives you a new URL or updates the existing one depending on your setup.
